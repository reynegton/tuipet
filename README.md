A terminal virtual pet — Digimon V-Pet style — rendered with halfblock Unicode
sprites and animated in the terminal. It builds on the work of the Digimon V-Pet
fan community — see [Credits & acknowledgments](#credits--acknowledgments).

**Status: live and actively developed** — see the
[changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for what each release brought. tuipet is its own game: the core
V-Pet behaviour — every mechanic, animation, and evolution line — is built
on and verified against the real devices, with data cross-referenced against
community references. Regular updates ship as the game grows.

## What's inside

- **1,548 creatures**, 11 animation frames each, extracted from the game's
  sprite atlases as 1-bit bitmaps (`src/tuipet/data/sprites.json.gz`).
- A **basic V-Pet done properly**, every surviving system faithful to the
  real devices: care (hunger, effort, filth, sleep, lights), training
  drills, evolution (care-quality gates + DNA divergence + armor
  Digimentals + jogress), a rebuilt **Adventure** mode (26 real zones,
  bosses, towns), raid bosses, cups on a real-calendar schedule
  (seasons, weekends, holidays), a shop with the classic four-tab
  storefront, digitama earned by play (and bought outright in each town's
  own egg shop), an in-game AI care assistant, and the device's own screen
  transitions and animation timelines.
- **Online play** tuipet adds on top: accounts with cloud saves that follow
  you across devices, and a live lobby with chat, PvP battles, and two-player
  jogress fusion.
- **Global Localization**: The game auto-detects your system language and ships fully translated in 9 languages (English, Portuguese, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Russian, Japanese, and Simplified Chinese), with full dynamic double-width CJK font rendering support.
- A `rich`/`textual` UI: a fixed LCD arena with the animated pet, a live
  status card, and a one-line control strip — every screen lives in the box.

## Install

**Requires Python 3.10+.**

**One command:**

```sh
pip install tuipet && tuipet
```

Or with pipx / uv (isolated):

```sh
pipx install tuipet      # then: tuipet
uvx tuipet               # run without installing
```

Every sprite, sound, and CSV is bundled in the package — nothing else to download.

**On Termux (Android):** first `pkg install python`, then `pip install tuipet`. To
actually hear the LCD beeps you also need the **termux-api** package
(`pkg install termux-api`) *and* the **Termux:API** app from F-Droid/Play — the
package alone isn't enough: it installs a *bridge* that only works when the app
is there. Missing the app, tuipet detects that and falls back to the terminal
bell (Options → sound then reads *bell only*), so a silent install tells you
what's wrong instead of just being quiet. Over SSH, sound stays silent on purpose. The
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joeltco/tuipet/main/install.sh | bash`
script does all of that in one shot.

**On iPhone / iPad — use [a-Shell](https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/)
(the supported iOS way):** a-Shell is a free, open-source terminal on the App
Store that ships Python 3.11 — everything tuipet needs.

```sh
pip install tuipet
python3 -m tuipet
```

Use `python3 -m tuipet` rather than the bare `tuipet` command: a-Shell installs
console scripts somewhere `PATH` doesn't always look, and the module launch
always works. Tap the **⌨ key row** above the keyboard for `Esc` and the arrow
keys. Turn your phone to landscape (or drop the font size in a-Shell's settings)
if the panels wrap.

Two iOS notes, both handled for you:

* **Saves.** iOS forbids writing to `~`, so tuipet keeps your pet in
  `~/Documents/tuipet/` there instead of the usual `~/.local/share/tuipet/`. That
  folder is visible in the Files app, so your pet is backup-able and AirDrop-able.
  Set `TUIPET_SAVE_DIR` to put it anywhere you like.
* **Sound.** iOS sandboxes audio players, so tuipet falls back to the terminal
  bell (Options → sound shows *bell only*). Everything else — the lobby, battles,
  jogress, raids — works exactly as it does everywhere else.

**On iSH:** iSH's Alpine usually ships a Python older than 3.10, so
`pip install tuipet` fails with *"No matching distribution found"*. Prefer
**a-Shell** above — it's the smoother iOS experience.

## Run from source

```sh
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
tuipet           # or: PYTHONPATH=src python -m tuipet.app
```

Start from an **egg** — real dot-matrix egg designs; it wobbles, cracks, and hatches.

## Keys

The action bar reads in the in-game Help screen's order — care, then
explore, then grow, then manage:

| key | screen | key | screen |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| **f** | feed | **x** | DNA |
| **h** | heal an injury | **d** | DigiCore |
| **c** | clean | **e** | digitama guide |
| **o** | lights | **s** | shop |
| **v** | AI assistant | **b** | bag |
| **m** | battle | **n** | scenes |
| **a** | adventure | **g** | options |
| **r** | raid | **i** | bug report |
| **u** | tournament cup | **?** | help |
| **l** | online lobby | **q** | quit |
| **t** | train | **ENTER** | accept a found gift |
| **p** | discipline (praise·scold) | | |

SPACE works wherever ENTER does, and PageUp/PageDown leap through every
long list.

**m** is the battle key: a real recorded bout against a rival of your
pet's own stage, right at home — no purse, and each bout spends energy,
so the tank paces the fighting.  Beyond it, **PvE combat happens in
adventure, raids and cups; PvP battles and fusion happen in the lobby**.

## Care & evolution

Evolution uses the real V-Pet gating model: each form's
`digimon.csv` row gates on care **mistakes**, **overfeed**, **sleep
disturbances**, **weight** class, **battles/wins** and **generation**,
with the game's exact fulfilled-requirement scoring and deviation
tiebreak. Per-stage counters
reset on evolution; power and battle records carry for life. Good care with
focused training walks the classic lines; neglect finds Numemon.
Battle-gated Champions and above need real fights — adventure, raids and
cups feed the same record.

**Training** (`t`) is the timing drill: stop the sweep on the beat to land
the hit — effort and the drilled attribute power grow with clean rounds.
Battles resolve as the device's HP race.

**Armor evolution**: the shop's Eggs tab sells the 11 crest Digimentals in
their canonical discovery waves — Courage and Hope from day one, the crest
five after your first armor evolution, Light and Kindness at 25 wins,
Miracles behind the raid bosses, Destiny at generation 5. All 73 armor
forms are crest-exclusive, and the shop dossier names the form your pet
would become *right now*.

**DNA** (`x`) is the per-Field collectible layer: charge banked Field-DNA
into the pet to bend evolution toward gated forms, generate more, and read
any form's requirements. Charging one Field to its stage threshold **arms a
divergence**: the next evolution leaves the egg's chart for the evolution
graph's road in that Field — the door that makes the *entire* 1,500+ roster
raisable. The DNA screen's Divergence page maps where each Field can take
you; the DigiCore counts your album toward the full collection. **Jogress** (two-player DNA fusion) happens in the
lobby with a real partner — the partner's attribute picks the fusion via the
game's `attributeJogress` matrix.

**DigiCore** (`d`) is the canon EvolutionState page: the field-flavoured core,
the countdown to the next growth, and the blacked-out silhouette teaser of
what's coming — plus tuipet's own data-book pages.

## Raids & cups

Press **r** for raids: boss fights against the world's heavies, with a
shared community pool that **sizes itself to the crowd** — a small crew can
fell its boss, and every kill grows the next one. Each felled boss counts
toward egg unlocks and the Miracles Digimental wave; even an escaped boss
pays out by your share of the damage.

Press **u** for the cup page, which runs on the **real calendar**: seasonal
cup pools, a featured cup picked by the date (the weekend headliner is one
**your pet's own bracket** can win), and holiday specials — including
Odaiba Memorial Day on August 1. A grand-final chain that crosses real
seasons tells you which season's qualifier you're missing.
Each cup is the 8-entrant single-elimination bracket (Quarterfinal →
Semifinal → Final) with real rolled entrants; the other pairs auto-resolve
between your rounds. Titles pay the canonical purse, count trophies, and
gate tournament egg unlocks. An alarm can call you when a cup you care
about opens.

## Online

Press **l** for the lobby (accounts are free — pick a name and password).
Live **chat** with backlog, presence, private messages (threads keep their
full scrollable history), **PvP battles** (host-authoritative, with the
full round-replay animation), and two-player **jogress fusion**. TAB opens
the **monthly ladder** — online wins race a fresh season each month, and
past-season podium finishers claim a bits award, confirmed by the server.
**Password rooms** give you a private scope: everyone who types the same
phrase lands in the same room, chat and roster included. Your save syncs
to the cloud on the same account and follows you across devices —
last-write-wins with session leases, so a phone left running can't clobber
your desktop. Offline play is untouched; the network is fail-soft
everywhere.

## Scenes

Press **n** to change the backdrop — real ripped scenes, and each egg comes
wired to its own home scene, so the digitama you choose decides the view
your pet grows up with (until you repaint it).

## Shop, bag & economy

**s** opens the classic four-tab storefront — **[Food] Items Eggs Honors**
— stocked with the TUIPET catalog: real foods that get **eaten on the LCD**
through their own device art (fish, steak, a feast, one mushroom you should
NOT feed), care goods and growth tools, and **toys that actually play** —
the ball bounces, the skateboard rides, the TV glows — each nudging a real
meter (exercise sheds weight, couch time buys energy). Every item wears its
own device sprite, and the live dossier shows the effect, a word of
character, what you already hold, and (for a crest egg) the armor form it
would trigger right now. **b** is the bag: use with ENTER, sell back for
half with R. Birthdays hand out treats you can actually eat. The Honors
board sells cosmetic tamer titles for the truly rich.

**Digitama are earned by playing** — reaching stages, felling raid bosses,
winning cups, clearing adventure zones, celebrating festivals, growing your
album — exactly like the real devices; the carousel shows only what you can
hatch and teases the one you're closest to earning. **On the road, each
town's egg shop also sells a distinct band of eggs outright** — the real 8×8
egg sprites, a paid shortcut that drops straight onto your carousel, and no
two towns stock the same eggs.

## AI assistant & options

**v** hires the device's auto-care AI (per-stage retainer and per-care fees —
it minds the pet, at a price). **g** opens options: account switching, sound backend, updates,
key reference, theme, and the new-game/erase controls.

## Updating

tuipet **updates itself**. On launch it checks PyPI in the background, installs
any newer release, and tells you to restart to play it — the running process
keeps the version it started with, so the new one comes up next time.

Prefer to do it yourself? Press **a** on the options → Update row to switch
auto-update off; you'll still be told when a release is out. You can also press
ENTER there to check now, and ENTER again to install on the spot.

Where tuipet can't run pip for you — **iOS** sandboxes subprocesses, and a
source checkout has no release to install over — it hands you the command
instead of pretending it updated.

## Saving

Automatic — local save every 10 seconds and on quit, with backup generation.
With an account, the same save syncs to the cloud in the background.

**A closed game is a stopped clock.** Nothing happens while you're away: your
pet doesn't age, grow, incubate, get hungry, or make a mess. Quit for five
minutes or five months and you reopen to exactly the pet you left. Time passes
only while you're actually playing — and only on the main view, since every
menu pauses the sim too.

## Asset pipeline

Raw game files live under `_extract/` (gitignored). Re-extract with:

```sh
python tools/extract_sprites.py     # rebuilds data/sprites.json.gz
python tools/preview.py Agumon      # preview a creature as halfblocks
python tools/allframes.py Agumon    # see all 11 frames
```

The atlases are 672×672, an 11×11 grid: each **column** is one creature, each of
the 11 **rows** is an animation frame. Creatures are authored at 3× scale on a
cyan LCD background; the extractor box-downsamples 3× (recovering native 16px
sprites and dropping the dev-build column labels) and thresholds to 1-bit.

## Sprite frame convention

Each creature's 11-frame strip uses a fixed pose order, reverse-engineered from
the game's own `View/SpriteAnim.class` (cfr-decompiled). Animations in
`src/tuipet/data.py::ROLES` mirror the game's `cheer`/`jeer`/`eat`/`idleSleep`/etc.

| idx | pose                          | used by                          |
|-----|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 0   | idle / walk A                 | idle bob (0,1), walk             |
| 1   | idle / walk B                 | idle bob, play, tantrum          |
| 2   | sleep / rest A                | `idleSleep` (2,3), wake stretch  |
| 3   | sleep / rest B                | `idleSleep`                      |
| 4   | angry / refuse / attack       | jeer, refuse head-shake, battle  |
| 5   | happy / cheer-up              | cheer (good), play               |
| 6   | sad / unhappy                 | jeer (bad), tantrum, attack      |
| 7   | eat-closed (chew) / cheer-down| eat (8↔7), heal, cheer           |
| 8   | eat-open (mouth) / neutral    | eat, heal, default expression    |
| 9   | tired / sick / disliked / old | fatigue idle, geriatric, dislike |
| 10  | exhausted (very tired)        | deep-fatigue idle                |

`refuse` is drawn as a left/right mirror flip on alternating frames (head-shake).

## Credits & acknowledgments

tuipet stands on the shoulders of the **Digimon V-Pet fan community** — a whole
ecosystem of hobbyists who reverse-engineered, documented, and preserved these
devices. It draws on the work of many of them, including:

- **[DVPet](https://theundersigned.itch.io/dvpet)** by *theundersigned* —
  tuipet began as a study of this fan game, and its sprite bank and early
  data came from it.
- **[humulos.com/digimon](https://humulos.com/digimon)** — device evolution,
  egg, and roster documentation used to build and verify the lines.
- **MultiVPet** and **Digimon Unlimited** — community sprite/stat extractions
  cross-referenced during development.
- the wider V-Pet preservation scene whose archives made any of this possible.

Sincere thanks to every one of these creators and archivists — none of this
would exist without your work.
