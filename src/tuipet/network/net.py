"""Lobby network client — the tuipet side of the multiplayer relay.

A `LobbyClient` runs as one asyncio task inside Textual's event loop. It owns a
`LobbyState` snapshot that the lobby Panel reads on each render tick (everything
runs on the one loop, so no locking). Outgoing messages are fire-and-forget via a
queue; incoming messages update the snapshot or land in `inbox` for the session
logic (jogress/battle) to drain.
