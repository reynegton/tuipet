"""Blocking cloud-save helpers for the launch/quit edges.

The pet save lives on the lobby server keyed by account (see server.py). To make
a pet follow you across devices we:
  * pull synchronously at startup, BEFORE the pet is loaded, and mirror a newer
    cloud save down to the local file — so the normal load path just picks it up
    (no mid-session pet swapping);
  * push synchronously on quit so the final state is captured.
During the session the app pushes incrementally via net.SyncClient (autosave).

Everything here is fail-soft: offline / bad password / timeout simply returns
without syncing, so the game always runs.
