"""The LCD fx ENGINE (tier-2 split, 2026-07-17): the care-action
animations — start_fx's beat/sound tables, advance_fx's chain rules, the
per-kind _fxk_* painters — plus the filth/status overlays and the geometry
constants they share with the Screen widget.  arena.py keeps the widget
(paint, crossfade, the roamer) and imports every old name back, so
`tuipet.arena.X` and `tuipet.app.X` keep resolving.

The fx-painter status-UI law (2026-07): idle-family poses play in place
with the status actors up; care anims anchor centre with the canon
resetScreen() blackout.  Classify any NEW fx against the decompile before
wiring it.
