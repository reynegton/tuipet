"""The ONE attack-volley animation, shared by the battle screen and every training drill
(single source of truth -- so the pet's fire / orb-flight / impact look identical everywhere).

A volley is the battle player's attack, cloned as an alternating-view sequence (only one
combatant on screen at a time): the attacker rears back and fires its orb off the near grid
edge -> the view switches to the TARGET as the orb arrives -> a fullscreen impact flash ->
the target breaks (hit) or the attacker deflates (miss).  battlescreen owns the beat timings
(WINDUP_T / FIRE_T / ...); this module owns the geometry + orb flight so both stay in lockstep.
