"""Optional sound backend: play DVPet's WAV sound effects when an audio player
is available, otherwise stay silent so the app can fall back to the terminal
bell.

Detection avoids playing on the wrong machine: inside an SSH session we never
spawn a desktop player (it would play on the server, not at your terminal);
Termux's termux-media-player always plays on the phone, so it's preferred.

# 2026-07-15: "chop that sound volume in half").  None of the allowlisted
# players share a volume flag (termux-media-player and aplay have none at
# all), so volume is applied to the SAMPLES: each level keeps a lazily-built
# cache of pre-attenuated copies that any player can just play.
#
# The slider is PERCEPTUAL, not raw amplitude (v1 mapped 50% to 0.5x, a mere
# -6dB -- "still blairing", Joel 2026-07-15): the baseline chop is baked into
# the TOP of the scale, so 100% is the default and already plays at half
# amplitude, and each step down squares away real decibels (50% = 1/8
# amplitude, ~-18dB; 10% = a whisper).  Range 10..100 in steps of 10 -- there
# is no 0, the sound switch is the mute.
