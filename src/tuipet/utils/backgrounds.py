"""The DSprite background catalog, wired to the eggs (BASIC VPET 2026-07-16).

Habitats are gone (Joel: "remove the habitats. wire in the dsprite
backgrounds") -- the scene behind the mon is decided by the EGG it hatched
from and stands for the pet's whole life, exactly like the real device's
per-version backgrounds (the old egg0Back..egg11Back sheets this system
replaces).  The art is the DSprite rebuild's rip set (Joel-approved source
2026-07-15).  Several scenes ship as time-of-day / recolour FAMILIES of one
composition -- verified by structural correlation of the actual pixels, not
filenames (scene-name audit 2026-07-20): the island at sunset/day/night, the
flower field day/sunset, the seafloor day/deep/sunset, the city towers and
the bay bridge and the factory day/night, the tree path green/golden.  They
are grouped and named as such in NAMES below.

The egg->scene wiring is derived, not invented: each egg's hatch line maps
through its members' natural habitats (digimon.csv Habitat, the same table
the habitat system read) onto the DSprite rebuild's own biome->scene map;
lines with no habitat data fall back to their dominant FIELD.  A handful of
flavor overrides are marked inline.

DEFAULT = "greenhills"          # the DM20 background rip; also the fallback

# key -> display name (the clone catalog + the off-catalog data scenes).
# DISPLAY names only -- the KEYS are wired (EGG_BG, pet.bg_pick in saves) and
# never change.  THE FAMILY LAW (scene-name audit 2026-07-20, done by LOOKING
# at the pixels + structural correlation, Joel: "you keep guessing instead of
# looking at the actual pictures... duplicates with time differences"): a
# scene shipped as several time-of-day / recolour sheets shares a family word,
# and each member says its time.  Corrections this pass:
#   * cove is a BEACH (sand foreground, water beyond) -- it was mislabelled
#     "Sandy Seafloor" and grouped with the seafloors, but it has ZERO
#     structural correlation with them.  It is its own shore.
#   * the real seafloor is ONE undersea scene at three lightings:
#     underwater=Seafloor (day), seafloor=Seafloor Deep, sunsetshore=Seafloor
#     Sunset.  (The old catalog counted the beach as the third seafloor and
#     left the actual sunset seafloor named like a "shore" -- backwards.)
#   * tealhollow is a SEPARATE teal-underwater V, not the green/golden path
#     recolour (corr 0.40, not 1.00) -- kept apart from the tree-path pair.
# Grouped by verified family:
