"""The ONE creature grid every screen sits on -- the single source of truth for the
LCD's usable real estate, so battle / training / jogress / tournament / evolution /
adventure / the main roaming view all share ONE geometry (no per-screen drift).

The LCD is 40x24px.  Sprites live in a 32x16 window centred in it:

    x in [X0, X1)   ==  [4, 36)      (4px margin each side)
    y in [TOP, FLOOR) == [6, 22)     (a 16px-tall band)
    every sprite BASELINES on the floor -> its bottom pixel lands at y21,
    which is 2px above the y23 bottom border.

Rules enforced by the helpers below:
  - in-grid : no sprite pixel escapes x[4,36) / y[6,22)
  - grounded: content bottoms at y21 (render_scene already baselines there)
  - no overlap: face-off placements are pulled to opposite edges with a centre gap
