"""DVPet ambient-animation cadence, isolated as pure helpers so the timing is
testable without Textual.

The whole engine rests on one invariant from the decompiled game: SpriteAnim
sets ``_interval = targetFPS / 10`` frames, so ``_interval`` is exactly 1/10 of
a second and every ``_frame == _interval * N`` check fires N tenths of a second
into a state.  tuipet therefore drives animation on a single 10 Hz tick where
**one tick == one interval == 0.1 s**, and each state below reproduces DVPet's
beats one-for-one in real time, independent of frame rate.
