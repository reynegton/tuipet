"""Item-use animations — DVPet's per-AnimationType scripts (item-anim audit
2026-07-07: EVERY toy funneled into jumping(), canon's script for the
Trampoline alone — "balloons and futons have broken in game animations").

Each items.csv AnimationType is an Enum.State the device dispatches to its
own SpriteAnim method (playing / bouncing / riding / studying / lifting /
bathing / showering / interactingSound + the four Interact variants /
angrySurprise).  They share one stage: the ITEM at the left floor animating
its own icon frames, the PET at the right posing along, sounds on canon
beats (View/soundConfig.csv wav names, verbatim), and almost all of them
chain into cheer() at the end — angrySurprise chains into jeer().
PlayAngry/InteractAngry are dead canon (never queued by the model).

Scripts are TABLES, not code: `rows` fire once at their beat (canon's
`_frame == _interval * N` branches, 0.1s ticks 1:1), `every` applies per-beat
deltas over a range (the bounce arc, the ride-off).  Canon's 105px stage maps
onto the 40px arena at ~0.4 (moves of 6px -> 2, 3px -> 1); canon item frames
are 1-based over 8 -> ours cycle the 4 extracted frames ((n-1) % 4).
