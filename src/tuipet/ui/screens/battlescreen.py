"""Battle — the alternating-view volley show over the precomputed HP race
(the 0.5 battlescreen, ported 2026-07-17; DSprite is the ultimate truth
for animations and mechanics).

The fight itself is decided by battle.generate() (care, training, stage and
the attribute triangle feed each side's hit chance; the trained hit-type
sets damage).  This screen plays it back one round at a time: whoever fires
is shown alone, the orb flies off-screen, the defender dodges or eats the
blast.  Before the fight a TIMING BAR sets your hit-type for the bout —
good condition widens the mega window (care widens skill).
