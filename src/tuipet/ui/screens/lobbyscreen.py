"""Multiplayer lobby panel — name login, presence, chat, jogress + battle sessions.

Chat-focused layout: a scrolling chat log on the left, a roster sidebar on the
right. Phases:

  name     type a handle, Enter to join  (only when no cached tamer name)
  lobby    chat default; Up/Down pick a player; Enter on empty input opens that
           player's action menu ([B]attle / [J]ogress); invites pop a [Y]/[N]
  jogress  both relay their pet's attribute, each resolves its fusion locally
           (jogress.resolve), shows the result, Enter evolves the pet
  battle   seeded symmetric PvP (proto 2, canon BattleProtocol's peer-symmetric
           exchange with the desync solved): both relay battle cards carrying a
           nonce COMMITMENT, reveal the nonce with the first pick, and derive a
           shared PRNG seed -- then each round both exchange only their FINAL
           attribute pick and each side resolves the identical card-vs-card engine
           locally. Neither peer trusts the other's arithmetic, so the monthly
           ladder's both-reports-must-agree check is real. A peer whose card
           has no "proto" gets the pre-2 host-authoritative relay verbatim
           (the inviter resolves and mirrors absolute results). PvP wins
           record onto the pet (evolution credit) just like PvE.

Decoupled from the app: `on_connect(name, card) -> LobbyClient` lets the app own
the WebSocket worker's lifecycle. Colours come from the live theme.
