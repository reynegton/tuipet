"""Adventure town hub (rebuild 2026-07-20): a visitable stop on the road.

The old town was a full hub (Food · Items · Eggs · Sell · Cups) via a web of
helpers that left with the town system.  Rebuilt in phases: T1 = the enterable
hub with a working SHOP (the real ShopPanel, reused).  T4 = a DISTINCT road-only
TOWN CUP -- its own trophy (tournament.town_cup, id 900+), an open bracket run
by the real Tournament engine, one per town visit.  Later: Sell, Eggs.

A SubHost: the shop OR a cup match rides as a child (the old town hosted both);
returns ('done', None) to the adventure when the pet leaves.
