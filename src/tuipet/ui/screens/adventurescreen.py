"""Adventure — tuipet's OWN expedition (rebuild FOUNDATION, 2026-07-20).

This is the skeleton the expedition engine grows into: the menu action, the
can_adventure() gate, and the REAL canon teleport (SpriteAnim.teleportLeave /
teleportArrive / teleportAppear) carried VERBATIM from the pre-0.5.8 build --
leaving home and returning both ride the same striped-curtain wipe.

⛔ OWN-GAME LAW (Joel 2026-07-13, carried forward): DVPet is NOT canon for
adventures.  One biome per run, cross a zone in ~40 interactive travel actions,
victory teleport home.

Built so far: the teleport (verbatim); the MARCH -- the pet walks the run's one
backdrop while the journey rides a ribbon (adventure.Adventure), arrival
teleports it home with the verdict, ESC turns back; and WILD ENCOUNTERS -- a
per-leg roll pulls a real roster enemy that fights through BattlePanel (a
SubHost child), a loss costs an adventure life, and 0 lives fails the run home;
the real 26-ZONE GEOGRAPHY (adventure.ZONES from data.load_maps -- each zone its
own biome + wild table); the zone BOSS FIGHT -- the end opens the gate boss,
felling it is the win, a survivable loss stands the pet at the gate to try again
(SPACE) or turn back (ESC); TRAVEL DRAIN -- marching tires the pet (⚡ energy on
the strip), burns weight and tops effort; TOWNS -- a mid-zone rest that refills
lives + energy; and PROGRESSION -- the ZonePickPanel picks an unlocked zone,
felling a boss unlocks the next (pet.adv_progress); and FINDS -- spot loot on
the road, ENTER digs it into the bag; the home STATUS CARD; and TRANSPORT -- press T
mid-march to spend a town/danger warp item (skip ahead, rest or get ambushed).
Nothing here is faked.
