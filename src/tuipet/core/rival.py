"""The NAMED RIVAL — one recurring tamer per generation (Joel 2026-07-26:
"build the named rival too").

Home battles were matched but anonymous: every opponent a stranger, every win
a stat.  Now each generation has ONE named rival — a tamer with a pet of its
own line whose form always matches YOUR stage (it grows alongside you), who
answers every CADENCE'th home bout, and whose head-to-head record persists
until the generation ends.  Beating a stranger is a stat; beating THEM is a
story.

The rival's identity rides the pet save (pet.rival_name / rival_line), so the
feud dies with the pet and the heir meets a fresh face.  Its bout runs the
ordinary Battle engine on an ordinary species card — same stage bracket as
pick_enemy, ideal condition, no purse — so nothing about balance changes;
only the NAME on the fight does.  Rival bouts wear the arena backdrop (a
visiting tamer brings the ring with them)."""
