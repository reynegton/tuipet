"""Tournament -- DVPet's HOME tournament (Tournament.java + tournies.csv).

The real thing is a SCHEDULED 8-entrant bracket, not an always-open menu:

- Each game day, dailyChange rolls a 24-slot trophy schedule (one cup per game
  hour) from the season's pool -- randTrophyIDs interleaves the age tiers
  (open/Rookie/open/Champion/open/Ultimate/open/Mega) so tier cups pepper the
  day.  Only the CURRENT hour's cup is enterable (checkTourneyClosed).
- Entry runs Tournament.isEligible: not already fought today (SameDayRetry
  cups exempt), not too old for an age-limited cup, field/attribute
  restrictions, and a Prelim chain (its qualifier beaten this season).
  DVPet's fully-recovered gate has no tuipet analog (battle HP is per-fight).
- The bracket is the player + 7 entrants drawn from the DEX (TournamentAble
  forms filtered by the cup's stage/field/attribute rules; the default
  tier follows the pet's AGE via TourneyRandom*Age).  Each entrant rolls real
  stats: stage-banded HP and a power total split main/2 weak/6 rest/3 by its
  attribute.  Pairs are (0,1)(2,3)(4,5)(6,7) with the player at a random slot;
  the OTHER matches auto-resolve between rounds.
- Prizes: calcBits = sum over the 7 entrants of their stage's Tourney*Bits x
  the cup's BitModifier (a Mega entrant pays TourneyMaxBits once the pet is
  past TourneyRandomMegaAge).  Losing still pays: nothing from the
  quarterfinal, a third from the semi, half from the final.
