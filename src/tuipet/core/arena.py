"""The animated LCD arena: the Screen widget plus its fx painters and the
filth / status-effect overlays.

Lifted out of app.py verbatim (modularization 2026-07-08) — this is the render
half of the old app module.  app.py imports the public names back
(Screen, hearts, bar, _effect_overlay, SCREEN_COLS/ROWS, ...) so
`tuipet.app.Screen` and the existing tests keep resolving.  Nothing here imports
app, so there is no cycle.

NOTE: the Screen renderer resolves `render_screen` in THIS module's namespace.
Tests that spy on it must patch `tuipet.arena.render_screen`, not `tuipet.app`.
