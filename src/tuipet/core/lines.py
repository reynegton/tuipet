"""Evolution lines — the LINES_SPEC.md engine (arc 1).

An egg is a line: a curated, DM20-shaped subtree of the corpus. A pet hatched
from a line egg evolves ONLY inside its line, judged by first-match bracket
rules instead of the corpus fulfilled-score engine. Rules read the per-stage
care counters (care_mistakes / stage_trainings / overeat / stage_battles) and
the rolling battle_log, so every evolution is a legible verdict on this
stage's care.

Rule grammar (LINES_SPEC §2) — comma = AND, `|` = OR, first matching row wins:
