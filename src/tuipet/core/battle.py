"""Battle — the 0.5 HP race (clone rebuild 2026-07-15; ported onto the
classic tree 2026-07-17, Joel: "replace the battle system" — DSprite is
the ultimate truth for animations and mechanics).

Both sides start at 5 HP.  The whole fight is PRECOMPUTED round by round
(the screen replays it): each round both sides roll to hit; damage per
landed hit is the side's PROJECTILE count, which comes from its trained
hit-type (mega: 90% double / normal: 50% / miss: 20%).  The per-round hit
chance is care's scoreboard — win rate, stage rank, this-stage training,
lifetime training, strength/hunger/energy meters, weight closeness and the
attribute triangle all feed it.  Transcribed EXACTLY from the source rule
set (ripped from multiple fan games).
