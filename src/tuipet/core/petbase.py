# so a heart took 1,800 of those (1.2 game-days) and a full belly FIVE --
# while ordinary neglect killed the pet at 3.5.  Hunger therefore never
# reached zero in a natural life: the hunger call, both "too hungry"
# refusals and the starvation death were all unreachable, and feeding was
# optional in a game about feeding.
#
# Tied to the day so it can never drift out of scale again: 4 hearts x
# (2 x CALORIE_LIMIT) lapses each == one DAY_MINUTES.  A heart is ~6 real
# minutes of play, a full belly one game-day -- the device's own rhythm,
# where you feed the thing a few times a day.

# ⭐ THE SIBLING CLOCKS, PUT ON THE DAY TOO (Joel 2026-07-25: "retune the
# poop and effort clocks too", right after the hunger ruling).  Both were
# left on the old scale when the belly moved, and beside a one-game-day
# belly they were absurd: a pile every 1.9 GAME-DAYS and an effort heart
# every 2.1, so a pet produced half a mess a day and its gauge took eight
# days to empty.  Neither chore could become a rhythm, and the effort CALL
# -- which books a care mistake exactly like the hunger call -- could
# barely fire.
#
# POOP follows MEALS, the device's own coupling: four piles a game-day,
# the same cadence as the four hunger hearts, so eating and cleaning keep
# step.  EFFORT is deliberately gentler than the belly -- a drill is a
# bigger ask than a meal -- so its four hearts drain over ~1.3 game-days.
# Both are expressed against DAY_MINUTES so they cannot drift out of the
# day the way the belly did.

# ⭐ THE SPECIES SPREAD IS COMPRESSED (Joel 2026-07-25, option b: "keep the
# multiplier but compress its range" -- his report, "is th mon supposed to
# be pooping during sleep?").  The line above tunes the MODAL species, and
# the retune that set it verified "four piles a game-day" against exactly
# that species -- but the interval is `BASE * (poop_limit/poop_lapse) /
# REF_POOP_RATIO`, and the roster's lapse runs 1 / 2 / 8 / 16:
#
#     lapse  1 -> 1358 species ->  4 piles/game-day   (the number we tuned)
#     lapse  2 ->    7 species ->  8
#     lapse  8 ->  116 species -> 32
#     lapse 16 ->  116 species -> 64      <- a pile every 22 game-minutes
#
# So 232 species (14.5%) were left pooping 32-64 times a day.  That also
# defeated the SLEEP rule: canon holds the gauge at night and lets only a
# DESPERATE 2x gauge go, which for the modal pet is 12 game-hours (it never
# fires in a 10-hour night, measured) -- but at a 22-minute interval the
# threshold falls inside the night and a sleeper goes repeatedly.
#

# is compressed so the fastest species poops at most twice as often as the
# slowest, instead of sixteen times.  Ordering is preserved throughout.
