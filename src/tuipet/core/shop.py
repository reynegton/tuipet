"""The shop: a fixed catalog of priced items (the DSprite item system,
cloned from the v0.4.x rebuild -- BASIC VPET 2026-07-16).

Every priced entry in vitems.json is on the shelf, grouped by its own
category column; buying moves it into the bag at face value; the bag can
sell it back for half.  Effects live in Pet.use_item — the token text here
mirrors those exact effects so the shelf, the bag and the belly can never
disagree.  The DVPet rolled-slot/town-hours shop machine is retired; the
town counters serve the same catalog.  The digitama-licence shelf was cut
2026-07-17 ("i never wanted egg licenses"): eggs unlock by condition only,
like the real devices -- the shop sells goods, never digitama.

class Item(NamedTuple):
    """One catalog entry, with its fields NAMED (items refactor P1,
    2026-07-23).  The authored table below stays a plain aligned tuple
    literal -- it reads better as a table and the churn of 37 keyword
    calls buys nothing -- but every CONSUMER now says `.category`
    instead of `v[3]`, which was the actual complaint (scoping board
    P-A).

    Still a tuple, so indexing keeps working.  The first SIX fields are
    the authored contract and must never be reordered -- P2 appended to
    the end, and anything later appends further.

    P2 (2026-07-23) added the last three:

    * `touches` -- the LIVE pet stats this item's `use_item` handler
      moves DIRECTLY.  This is the yardstick for "redo them all to fit
      everything we got going on" (plan §2 goal 2): a pin walks it and
      fails if an item aims at a stat that is dormant or does not exist.
      Side channels are deliberately NOT listed -- `_set_energy` bills
      obedience when a drop lands in the red, and `_disturbed()` bills a
      care mistake, but those belong to those helpers, not to the item.
    * `where` -- "home" (usable from the bag) or "road" (spent on the
      march; the home bag refuses it).  Replaces reading intent out of
      refusal STRINGS (scoping board P-F).
    * `tier` -- rarity slot.  DECLARED, NOT POPULATED: it is the hook the
      distribution arc attaches to (plan §7), and populating it here
      would be inventing an economy nobody has ruled on."""
