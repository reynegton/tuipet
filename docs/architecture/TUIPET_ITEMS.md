# TUIPET ITEMS — the catalog contract (BUILT 2026-07-18)

> STATUS: SHIPPED in v0.5.60; taglines (the CATALOG's 6th field, shown in
> the live dossier) followed in v0.5.61.  shop.CATALOG is the single
> source; this doc is the design record.
> Law of the redo: **DSprite is the mechanics grammar, DVPet is the art.**
> Every item below wears a REAL DVPet atlas strip (verified: all 59 foods and
> all 84 items carry 4-frame rips — zero quiet cells needed). No effect below
> invents a system: each acts on a meter or hook that is LIVE today.

## ⚠ UPDATE 2026-07-23 — read this before trusting anything below

The catalog is **37 entries** now (Food 11 · Care 9 · Toy 7 · Evolution 5
· Adventure 3 · Medical 2).  Three things in the original text went
stale the same day:

1. **"obedience ... injuries" are no longer dead systems.**  The canon
   restoration brought INJURY back (v0.5.205: battles wound, the
   BANDAGE cures, a Vitamin guards) and DISCIPLINE back (v0.5.206: the
   obedience gauge is live, 0..150).  Any DVPet effect column speaking
   to those two is now addressable rather than a corpse.
2. **THE BANDAGE joined the catalog** (`i:80`, Care, 300b) — the real
   DVPet item, dormant since the 2026-07-16 strip.
3. **The Vitamin gained its canon second job**: a live vitamin guards
   against battle injury for a game-day.

### Item SHOWS are no longer hand-mapped (v0.5.207-209)

`shop.TOY_SCRIPTS` — a 7-entry hand-map — is **RETIRED**.  Two doors
decide what an item plays, both derived from data:

* `shop.item_is_eaten(key)` → the `f:` sheet.  foods.csv carries no
  AnimationType **because eating IS the animation**, so every food-sheet
  item (the 11 foods + both drinks, both pills, the vitamin, the
  anti-evo chip) plays the eat fx with its own icon.
* `shop.item_script(key)` → items.csv's own `AnimationType` column,
  reached through the icon key (**`i:N` IS the row id**).  Excluded by
  key: digimemory, both transports, life_recovery, revive_floppy (own
  doors).  Writing a new `itemfx.SCRIPTS` entry **auto-wires** the item.

**Never reintroduce a hand-map.**

## The sources, in one breath

* **DSprite** ships 17 consumables + 11 Digimentals + dormant relics
  (miracle egg / miracle fruit / VIP ticket) + 28 theme skins. Text-only shop
  — no item art anywhere. Its EFFECT vocabulary: fill/curb hunger, energy,
  weight, force/limit sleep, wake, trainings, stage-time, evolution block,
  X-antibody, revive, auto-clean, mistake eraser, a kill-trap fruit,
  route-selector fruits.
* **DVPet** ships 59 foods + 84 items, every one with a real 4-frame strip —
  but its effect columns speak dead systems (mood, enthusiasm, nutrition
  macros, obedience, temperature, injuries, adventure life, transports).
  The art is gold; the numbers are corpses.

TUIPET items = DSprite's (proven) effect grammar + tuipet's own live systems,
each carried by the DVPet item that owns the art.

## TOYS tab-mates (Joel: "so the toys are worthless?" — every toy turns a
live dial; exercise sheds weight, couch time buys energy at a weight price)

## EGGS tab — unchanged
The 11 Digimentals (i:15–25, real art, wave gates) stay exactly as shipped.

## What leaves the shelf
best/normal/worst fruit (the 1000b food duds — their canon route-selector job
is NOT revived: lines + DNA divergence own evolution steering), deadly_fruit
(succeeded by Poison Mushroom), super_carrot (→ Slim Drink), premium_meat
(→ Steak), junk_food (→ Cheese burger), care_mistake_eraser (→ Textbook),
alarm_clock (→ Music Player), time_gear (→ Grow Capsule). Old saves: a
