# DISTRIBUTION — the spread arc (plan, draft 1)

Joel 2026-07-23: "once thats refactored, we gotta spread them all out.
tiered rarities. zone shop exclusives, etc." → 2026-07-24: "lets move on
to distributions".

The items refactor is CLOSED (ITEMS_REFACTOR_PLAN §10, P1-P6, v0.5.218).
44 items, one grouping, `tier` declared and empty on every entry.

**Nothing here is agreed.**  §4 is the ruling list.

## 1. GROUND TRUTH, re-derived 2026-07-24 (two prior claims were STALE)

### ⚠ Corrections to what the old audit board says

- **Adventure loot is keyed by SCENE (biome), not by zone slot number.**
  `zone_finds()` reads `BIOME_FINDS[scene]`.  The 2026-07-23 diversity
  audit's F1 ("keyed to the zone's SLOT NUMBER, 1-1 == 2-1") describes a
  state that no longer exists, and I repeated it once before checking.
- **The endgame zones no longer dig one item.**  `FINAL_ZONE_FINDS` is 5
  items (anti_evo_chip, x_antibody, textbook, dna_crystal, steak), so
  audit F2 is also closed.

Do not plan against that board without re-deriving first.

### ⚠ P6 moved distribution as a SIDE EFFECT, before this arc started

`shopConsumable.csv` authors 22 town-shop overrides; entries whose icon
has no catalog key are silently dropped.  P6 added seven chips, so
**10 previously-dropped overrides now resolve** — kept went 5 → 12.
Consequence, unplanned and already live in v0.5.218:

| good | towns stocking it |
|------|-------------------|
| vaccine_chip | 16 |
| virus_chip | 16 |
| anti_evo_chip | 16 |

That is *canon-authored* placement (DVPet decided it, not me), so it is
defensible — but it was a side effect, not a decision, and this arc
should either ratify or override it.  **10 overrides are still dropped**:
`i:28 i:31 f:26 f:27 f:31 f:39 f:40 f:56 i:81 i:82`.

### The spread as it stands

**Zones** — 26 zones over **11 scenes**, very unevenly:

| scene | zones | | scene | zones |
|-------|-------|-|-------|-------|
| factorynight | **8** | | islandsea | 1 |
| mountains | 3 | | flowerfield | 1 |
| city | 3 | | desert | 1 |
| forestgate | 3 | | lakeside | 1 |
| underwater | 2 | | frozenpeak | 1 |
| greenhills | 2 | | | |

**Eight of 26 zones dig identical loot.**  That is the real texture
problem now — not slot-keying, but one scene owning a third of the map.

**Items** — 28 of 44 are findable somewhere; **16 never are**:
cake · cookie · cupcake · giga_meal · xylophone · port_potty ·
revive_floppy · digimemory · miracle_drink · and all 7 chips.

**Towns** — 35 distinct goods across 26 towns.  **9 items sit on no town
shelf at all**: ball · candy · cheese_burger · cookie · cupcake ·
digimemory · life_recovery · poison_mushroom · tuna.

**Coverage is lopsided by design-accident** (P2's map): `energy` is
touched by 12 items, `hunger` 10, `weight` 9 — while ~20 live stats have
exactly one item each.  Rarity that ignores this will feel arbitrary:
the singletons ARE the interesting items.

---

## 2. WHAT "TIERED RARITIES" COULD MEAN (the fork)

`tier` is declared and empty.  It can drive one or more of:

- **a) Stock rarity** — how often a town/home shelf carries it.
- **b) Find rarity** — its weight in a zone's loot roll (today every
  entry in a pool is equally likely).
- **c) Prize rarity** — raid/cup reward weighting.
- **d) Price** — tier implies a price band.

These are independent.  (d) is the most invasive: prices are canon-
derived for 20 of 44 items, and re-pricing would overwrite canon numbers
that P5/P6 deliberately took from the CSVs.

## 3. WHAT "ZONE SHOP EXCLUSIVES" COULD MEAN

Note the wording is **zone SHOP** exclusives, but zones do not have
shops — **towns** do, and towns sit ON zone legs (`town_legs`).  So this
is one of:

- **i)** each TOWN gets a signature good only it sells (a stronger
  version of the existing `_guest_deal`, which already deals 26 unique
  guest goods);
- **ii)** each ZONE gets a signature FIND only it drops (needs per-zone
  keying, since 8 zones currently share factorynight);
- **iii)** both.

With 44 items and 26 towns + 26 zones, **one exclusive each is
arithmetically impossible** without repeats or new items.  That is the
hard constraint this arc has to be designed around.

---

## 4. RULINGS NEEDED

- **D1 — what does `tier` DRIVE?**  Any of §2 a/b/c/d.  My read: (a)+(b)
  give the most felt change for the least risk; (d) fights the canon
  prices we just landed.
- **D2 — how many tiers, and what names?**  (e.g. common / uncommon /
  rare / legendary, or a 1-5 number.)
- **D3 — exclusives: towns, zones, or both?** (§3 i/ii/iii)
- **D4 — the 8 factorynight zones.**  Give them distinct loot (per-zone
  keying), or accept that one scene owns 8 zones?
- **D5 — the 16 never-found items.**  Do they become findable, stay
  shop-only, or is shop-only a deliberate tier in itself?
- **D6 — ratify or override P6's side effect** (chips in 16 towns).
- **D7 — the 10 still-dropped town overrides.**  Add those items (they
  include Elixir/Vitamin G, which R3 says must NOT be sold), leave them
  dropped, or re-point those town slots at existing goods?

## 5. WHAT I WILL NOT DO WITHOUT A NAMED ORDER

- Revive **Taste** (`_change_rank`) or **compensateAttributes** — both
  dormant, both pinned as deliberate refusals in `test_items_p6.py`.
- Re-price canon-derived items (D1d) — 20 of 44 prices come straight
  from the CSVs.
- Invent an economy: no new currencies, no gacha, no loot boxes.
- Sell an ailment cure (R3's symmetry) — this rules out the Elixir and
  Vitamin G that two of the dropped overrides want.

## 6. RULINGS RECEIVED

- **D1 = STOCK + FIND** (not price).  Shipped v0.5.219: tier derived from
  price, one curve drives both a town's daily ceiling and the road roll.
- **D3 = BOTH.**  Towns already dealt 26 unique guest goods; zones now
  carry 26 unique signature finds.  Shipped v0.5.219.
- **D4 = distinct loot for the 8 factorynight zones** -- solved by the
  per-zone signatures.  Shipped v0.5.219.
- **D6 = RATIFIED** (2026-07-24).  P6's side effect stands: the attribute
  chips stock across many town shelves (base chips ~15-16 towns, golden
  ~12, per the canon shopConsumable override table).  Now a decision on
  the record, pinned in test_distribution.py so an override edit can't
  silently drop it.

- **D7 = LEAVE THEM DROPPED** (2026-07-24).  The 10 unmatched town
  overrides stay unmatched.  Adding them would mean inventing items (no
  economy is being invented) or selling an ailment cure (R3 forbids the
  Elixir and Vitamin G).  Pinned in test_distribution.py as a DECISION,
  so a later item pass that gives one of those icons a key fails the pin
  and forces the choice back into the open.

- **D5 = MADE FINDABLE** (2026-07-24).  Cookie + cupcake now surface in
  the gentle early biomes alongside candy (the sibling treat that was
  always findable).  Still unbuyable, now discoverable.  digimemory stays
  the ONE hold-out: a wild chip has no ancestor payload, so a found one
  does nothing -- a dud the no-traps rule forbids -- and it is
  inheritance-only BY DESIGN.

---

## 7. ARC CLOSED

D1/D3/D4 shipped v0.5.219; D6 ratified; D7 ruled; D5 made findable.  All
seven rulings resolved.  Only never-found item left is digimemory, by
design.  The distribution arc is complete.
