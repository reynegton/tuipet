"""THE TRAINING AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Joel: "lets do a full blown training audit next."

The drill itself came through clean: it fits the box, it cannot be frozen
by mashing, its ledger is exactly what it advertises, and its timing bar
widens with care.  What the audit found was on the drill's DOOR -- and the
same root reached two more surfaces:

**THE SECOND AILMENT WAS WIRED INTO SOME DOORS AND NOT ITS SIBLINGS.**
Injury came back 2026-07-23 and was taught to `battle_condition` (a
wounded pet cannot fight).  Three places never learned it:

  1. `can_train` -- so a pet refused every bout was sent to do timed
     strike drills instead;
  2. `needs_care()` -- the trigger for the '!' icon, the alarm and the HUD
     call.  The restoration wired injury into `_alarm_urgency`, which only
     decides how LOUD an already-triggered alarm rings, so a pet that was
     ONLY hurt rang nothing and never reached the line written to name its
     cure: the alert existed and could not fire;
  3. that line itself, which sent a panicked tamer to the BAG for a
     Bandage the items refactor had moved to the free F menu two days
     later -- the identical bug v0.5.178 fixed for the pill, one line
     above it.
