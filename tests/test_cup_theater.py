"""CUP THEATER — the award ceremony + the visible NPC rounds (2026-07-21).

Pins the two beats that filled the cup's dead moments: after each of your
wins the field's other winners parade across the arena before the bracket
page lands, and the crown plays the podium ceremony before the tree and
the numbers.  Both lock input and play out (own-game law).
