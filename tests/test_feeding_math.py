"""Feeding/medicine math audit (2026-07): canon re-verification vs
PhysicalState.feed/applyFood/applyConsumable/feedMed/applyBandage/
checkDirtyEating/checkIntolerantFoodSick + config.csv column 1.

Verified matching: the fullness modifier ((hunger-full)/stomach, 1.0 for
strength foods), the taste-tier mood branches incl. the glutton mods, the
too-full refusal + overeat path, wolf-down pre-meal, nutrition ceil
scaling, intolerance rolls (50/50), the med double-dose structure and the
cured bonus /MaxLength shape, bandage double-wrap, checkMaxHoursBeforeSleep
(a bedtime-only-food gate: data-empty in the corpus, noted).

Fixed (canon divergences):
 * load_foods dropped SEVEN live columns: 39 calorie foods, 3 lifespan
   foods, 7 attribute foods, a sleep food, 2 temp foods had no effect.
 * The calorie buffer was a flat refill; canon ADDS the food's calories
   (a snack buffers less than a feast) and fattens by FoodWeightChange
   when calories rise while already positive.
 * Food weight was unscaled by the fullness modifier.
 * checkDirtyEating was unported: a meal amid filth costs mood -10 and
   rolls sickness per pile (16%/8%).
 * BadMedLifeDec is 3600 REAL-seconds: the port stored 3600 game-seconds
   -- a double dose cost 2.5 game-DAYS instead of one game-hour."""
