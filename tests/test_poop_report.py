"""JOEL'S POOP REPORT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Joel: "is th mon supposed to be pooping during sleep? is the poop
supposed to be visible during lights off? are we using the correct poop
sprites? my mons poop has sprite animations im not familiar with."

Three questions, one chain, three fixes.

P1 (FIXED, option b) — THE SPECIES SPREAD WAS NEVER COMPRESSED.  The
v0.5.258 retune tuned `POOP_INTERVAL_BASE` to four piles a game-day and
verified that against the MODAL species — but the interval is
`BASE * (poop_limit/poop_lapse) / REF_POOP_RATIO`, and the roster's lapse
runs 1 / 2 / 8 / 16.  232 species (14.5%) were left at 32-64 piles a
game-day: a pile every 22 game-minutes.  That also defeated the sleep
rule — canon holds the gauge at night and lets only a DESPERATE 2x gauge
go, which at a 22-minute interval falls well inside a 10-hour night, so
those pets went 5-6 times a night.  Joel ruled option b, "keep the
multiplier but compress its range": the canon ordering is kept, the range
squeezed to at most 2x, so the roster now spans 4.0-8.0 piles a day.

P2 (FIXED) — FILTH SHONE THROUGH THE BLACKOUT.  The lights-off branch
blanks the PET rows and passed the overlay straight through, so the piles
(flies and all) sat lit on a field that is meant to be DVPet's
fully-opaque `lightsOff` — the same cover that makes a dark-room fx "show
NOTHING".  The sick skull already reads the switch this way; the Zzz is
deliberately the one mark that survives.  The piles are unlit now, not
gone: flip the lights and they are all still there.

P3 (FIXED) — THE SIZE-4 PILE WAS DISTORTED ART.  `_poop_size()` produces
1-3, and the filth slots are built to Joel's layout law ("4 poops ==
16x16, and the mon NEVER walks over them") for exactly those: 7x7 / 8x7 /
8x8 in an 8-wide slot.  Size 4 is 10 wide.  It was reachable ONLY through
the backlog upgrade, and the renderer's safety then squashed it with
`fit_w` — a real rip distorted into a shape no device ever drew.  The
upgrade stops at 3; the size-4 rip stays in the data, unused, exactly as
arenafx already assumed.

NOT a defect (measured, and the answer to question 3): the poop IS
animated, and it is canon.  `poop_s1..s4` each carry two `animFilth`
frames that swap every 7 ticks awake / 10 asleep, and the moving pixels
are FLIES orbiting the pile.  Unfamiliar only because P1 made the piles
constant.
