"""Evolution reachability — the anti-soft-lock guarantee (Workstream A).

select() climbs via 'normal stage-up' edges (special=None, evol_item=-1, non-X)
plus 'Failed' forms when nothing else qualifies; the comment there promises a pet
"NEVER gets stuck below Mega". We verify the data backs that up:

  1. Every Fresh starter has a pure-timed-care path to a Mega.
  2. No climbable form below Mega can lose its path to Mega — i.e. you can never
     be *forced* toward a dead-end. (Jogress/fusion/X-only terminals exist by
     design — e.g. Liamon, Petaldramon — but they're always opt-in: reaching one
     means you chose stats for it over a Mega-bound sibling.)

Graph-only; no randomness, so these are stable. Skips if sprite assets are absent.
