"""FESTIVAL ROAD PRESENTS — the surprise reaches the road (2026-07-24).

Joel: "what about in adventure mode? on the road?"

Home gifts are home-only (checkGiftCall gates on _isHome), so a pet never
hands you a present while adventuring.  The road already had festival
BONUSES (2x loot, 2x bits); this adds the SURPRISE: on a festival, a third
of road finds are a wrapped present from the same gift pool -- dug up like
loot, revealed like a gift, capped at rare.
