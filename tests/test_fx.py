"""Care-animation (fx) state machine + re-trigger gating (Workstream C).

The #lcd Screen owns a care-action fx (eat/clean/cheer/...) advanced one step per
frame. Two correctness concerns:
  - an fx must run exactly `steps` frames then end (and 'clean' chains into the
    'cheer' sunshine);
  - a care action must not start a second fx while one is running (the re-trigger
    that caused the old feed-status flicker).

The state machine is tested directly here (methods bound onto a plain object, no
Textual mount). The per-action gating is verified by inspection: action_feed /
_clean / _praise / _scold / _play / _heal each early-return on
`self.screen_w.fx is not None` (and this test guards that the guard is present in
source). Pinning the engine means a refactor can't silently break completion or
the clean->cheer chain.
