"""Evolution-system canon audit pins (2026-07-06) vs DVPet Evolution.java.

The checker was already a deep verbatim port (consume-once DNA forgiveness,
checkStatTotal's GreaterThan+1 total, fractional attribute ratios, priority-
seeded fulfilled with scaleRate vs the CURRENT form's thresholds, the
probability roll boosted by the care bonus + winRate x 0.4, deviation over
passing gates only).  Found three timer-off/scoring slips (the two habitat
ones are HISTORICAL now -- the habitat system left, BASIC VPET 2026-07-16),
and
the X-antibody score is Induced-only (the Natural arm over-scored)."""
