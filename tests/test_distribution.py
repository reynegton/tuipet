"""DISTRIBUTION — tiered rarity + exclusives (2026-07-24).

Joel: "d1 stock and find, d3 both, d4 give them distinct loot".

D1  tier drives STOCK (a town's daily ceiling) and FIND (the road roll's
    weighting).  Not price -- 20 of 40 prices are canon DefaultPrice and
    re-pricing would overwrite numbers P5/P6 deliberately took.
D3  exclusives on BOTH sides: towns already deal 26 unique guest goods,
    and zones now carry 26 unique signature finds.
D4  the eight factorynight zones get distinct loot -- solved BY the zone
    signatures rather than by a second mechanism.

The tier itself is DERIVED FROM PRICE, never authored.  That is the whole
reason this arc invents no economy: price was already the game's opinion
of an item's worth, and the bands are just a reading of it.
