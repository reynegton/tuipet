"""The clock-unit law, pinned (cadence audit 2026-07-14).

tuipet's clock maps ONE GAME MINUTE onto ONE REAL SECOND (DAY_LENGTH=1440s =
1440 game minutes).  Canon config.csv cadences are in GAME MINUTES, so a
`*Min=N` constant ports to N REAL SECONDS -- never N x 60.  Converting with
REAL minutes has now shipped FIVE bugs: TEMP_RATE, WEATHER_CHECK_SEC, and the
three neglect-pressure cadences below.

Two constants are DELIBERATE exceptions and must stay that way -- they are
documented in pet.py and pinned here so a future audit cannot "correct" them:
  * the care-MISTAKE timers keep a fair human response window (a literal port
    gives you TEN REAL SECONDS to answer an alarm before a permanent mistake);
  * FilthSickMin pairs with a bound that is already divided by 60 -- rolling
    60x less often against a 60x smaller bound is the SAME expected rate.
