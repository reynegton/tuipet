"""EGG AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Probes over the whole egg surface: the bank (eggs.json.gz), the hatch
lifecycle, the unlock table, the three egg screens, the bank-index
migration, and the generational commit.  Three defects, fixed and pinned:

E1 (FIXED) — TOWNS SOLD THE NEVER-OWNABLE EGGS.  _sellable_eggs excluded
only the starters, so the five can_perm-FALSE lineage eggs (Kuramon,
Puttimon, Fufumon, Ryuda, Lalamon) reached town shelves (towns 0/2/5) and
town_egg_buy pushed them into persistence.egg_own -- permanent ownership
of eggs the design says are never ownable.  eggmigrate._sane_owned exists
to strip exactly these "however they snuck in": the shop was selling, for
800 bits, what the repair pass deletes.  The shelf filter and the single
buy path now both refuse.

E2 (FIXED) — AN EGG RE-ROLL PUMPED THE GENERATION.  Options->new egg on an
unhatched egg "hands off without ceremony" -- and _hatch_new treated that
hand-off as a full generational commit: five re-rolls took gen 2 to gen 7,
and the eventual hatch recorded max_gen 7, opening every gen-gated egg
(and the shop's gen-5 egg_of_destiny) with no lives lived.  A generation
is a LIFE -- snapshot_prev_gen has always refused to record an egg; the
commit now agrees: an unhatched re-roll keeps the generation.

E3 (FIXED) — THE RE-ROLL DESTROYED THE INHERITANCE.  The same commit
banked the EGG's own "care grade" (a flat 2) over the dead elder's banked
seed, and the etched Digimemory -- already taken from the bank by the
discarded shell -- died with it.  A re-pick now moves the whole estate to
the new shell: wallet, bag, trophies, DNA bank, the taken seed and the
etched memory, one chip only.
