"""Status-icon manifest + the Bandai-grammar placement rules (2026-07-11).

Verified vs SpriteAnim: the condition COLUMN order matches canon's setLocY
exactly (sick 55 / medicine 64 / injury 73 / bandage 83 / vitamin 93 /
fatigue 103, all active shown at once down the right edge); teach rides the
CREATURE (setDynamicComponentLocation), gated lights-on + awake, verbatim;
the 2-frame state blink (_stateNum) maps to tuipet's sf toggle; the emote
bubble (adjustEmotionLabel) and attention '!' zones.

Changed: the 2026-06-26 'for now' hide of st_medicine + st_teach is LIFTED
-- the med badge is the double-dose warning and teach flags a discipline
window that now expires with teeth (v0.2.182).

The MANIFEST (both directions, like the sound audit): every extracted icon
is either referenced by code or allowlisted with its reason below."""
