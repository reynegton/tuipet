"""THE ITEM SWEEP — the end-to-end pins (2026-07-24).

Joel: "audit the item sweep. it should be finished. look at everything and
harden."  The refactor (P1-P6) and the distribution arc (D1-D7) both closed
on STATIC pins: the catalog's shape, its tiers, its declared `touches`.
Nothing walked an item from the shelf to the belly and asked whether the
three agreed.  These do, and they are the ratchets for the five things the
sweep found:

  1. a raid's prize line named its goods out of vitems.json -- a file that
     since 2026-07-18 holds the Digimentals and the RETIRED shelf, so the
     biggest moment in the game printed "Energy.D, vitamin, dna_crystal";
  2. the road shelf's map-clear gate held in the home shop and nowhere
     else -- the first town on the road sold both warps at zero progress;
  3. Life Recovery was the one buyable good no town in the world stocked;
  4. the Grow Capsule advanced the growth clock by 2.5 stages while its
     shelf text said "+120min" -- and vaulted the pet into the Pen20
     frailty window on the way;
  5. the home daily deal (half off, unlimited) sold under the price the
     towns pay on demand (70%), an uncapped bits printer.

The `touches` pin at the bottom is the general one: it stops being a
DECLARATION and becomes a measurement.
