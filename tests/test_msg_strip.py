"""The message strip clears when a sub-screen opens (Workstream C / QoL).

Closing a screen flashes its farewell into the #msg strip; opening the next screen
used to leave that there, so e.g. "Pick a home." lingered on the Cup screen. Now
_open_mode clears the strip (each sub-screen carries its own note inside the LCD).
Driven through a real Textual pilot. Persistence is sandboxed by the autouse
isolate_save fixture; an account is preset so the first-launch panel is skipped.
