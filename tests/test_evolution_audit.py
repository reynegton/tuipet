"""THE EVOLUTION AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Joel: "lets do a full blown evolution audit next."

**This audit found nothing broken** — the first of the seven that didn't.
So what it leaves behind is the measurement itself, pinned: every egg
raised to a final form, every gate proved satisfiable, both off-chart
doors walked, and the pages measured against the box.  If a future edit
strands a line, resurrects a placeholder, forgets a counter reset or
writes a gate nobody can meet, one of these fails.

Three things I chased as bugs and proved were correct — recorded here so
nobody burns the time again:

  * a line row can read `unmet=0` while `ready=False`.  That is the DOOR
    shape: the checklist row is informational (`met=None`, e.g. "jogress
    with a Vaccine/Free partner"), so it counts as neither met nor unmet
    and the page names the road instead of pretending it is a countdown.
  * `dna_applied` is not emptied on evolve, it is ZEROED -- charges do
    clear, the dict just keeps its keys.
  * a crest egg's landing looks random because several armor forms can
    answer one crest; the shop dossier lists exactly that set.
