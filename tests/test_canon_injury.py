"""CANON RESTORATION — INJURY, the second ailment (2026-07-23, Joel:
"it was wrongfully stripped ... whatever is canon bring back").

The real hardware has two ailments with two meds: sickness (the pill)
and battle injury (the Bandage).  The 2026-07-16 strip took injury
whole; this restores it to the device rules on today's tree — the
decompile's BattleInjury table adapted (fatigue/mood coefficients left
with their dead systems), LOCAL bouts only, the vitamin as the canon
guard, one-dose cure in the pill's own grammar.
