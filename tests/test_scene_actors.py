"""BANDAI GRAMMAR (2026-07-11): the 32x16 matrix is a STAGE, not a dashboard.

Locked geometry (Joel, long-standing): 40x24 LCD, 32x16 play area grounded
2px above the bottom border -- untouchable.  The LCD carries SCENE ACTORS
only: the pet (full play area), the filth block, the sleep Zzz in the sky
corner, and the sick skull standing beside the pet like the real device
draws it.  Every BADGE (medicine/bandage/vitamin/fatigue/injury, teach,
the care-call '!', idle emotes) lives on the status side: the HUD deco,
the msg-box alarm, the digicore pages.  Care-fx scenes keep their own
in-scene emotes -- those are full-screen animations, the hardware way.

Hard invariant, swept at the pixel level: sprites never draw on another."""
