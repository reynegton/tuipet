"""No egg may be strictly DOMINATED by another (Joel 2026-07-14).

Slayerdra / Breakdra / Draco all hatched the identical Petitmon line and all
gated on the same thing -- AlbumCount 6 / 26 / 12 -- so Slayerdra strictly
dominated the other two: same reward, a quarter of the work.  Nobody would ever
unlock Draco or Breakdra.

Every other same-line group in the game is an ALTERNATE ROUTE (buy it with
adventure winnings / earn it in the lobby / earn it by raising well).  This pins
that rule: eggs that give the SAME thing must be earned in DIFFERENT ways.
