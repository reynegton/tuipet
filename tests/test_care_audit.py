"""THE CARE AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Joel: "lets do a full blown care audit next."

F1 (FIXED) — THE STARVATION CLOCK COULD NEVER FIRE.  `_starve_t`
accumulates dt, which is GAME-MINUTES, and was compared against
`12 * 3600` — a real-seconds shape asking for 43,200 of them, i.e. THIRTY
GAME-DAYS of unbroken starvation.  Measured, it reached 2,940 after three
game-days while the 20-mistake ladder was already at 13, so the death it
guards could not happen — on a field round 41 deliberately PERSISTED so
that quit-cycling couldn't dodge it.  The unit law's fourth instance, and
the warning for it sits twelve lines below the bug.

F2 (RULING, not fixed here) — the numbers behind it are pinned below so
the ruling starts from measurement: a full belly lasts ~5 GAME-DAYS, and
ordinary neglect kills at 3.5, so hunger cannot reach zero in a natural
life.  See CARE_AUDIT_2026_07_25.md §2.
