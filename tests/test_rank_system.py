"""Taste/rank drift canon audit pins (2026-07-06) -- the standing "rank system
unported" deferral, closed.

Already live before this arc: the FOOD ledger (a faithful simplified port) and
the TIME ledger (Joel's tuned adaptation after the misbehaving-ratchet
incident -- kept, with canon's sicken/injure hour-sours added).  Ported here:
the ATTRIBUTE ledger (drills warm, injuries and forced training sour, +-200
emergence feeding the Happy power bonus and the exercise spirit branches),
the WEAK injury tables keyed on the static species aversion, the food
forced-meal decs, and the PERSONALITY TRACKER (childhood energy/weight/mood
tallies re-rolling the temperament at the Champion evolution)."""
