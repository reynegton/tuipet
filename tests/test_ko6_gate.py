"""KO6 / Mega-class counter and the album egg axis (egg audit 2026-07-14).

⛔ JP/EN STAGE-NAME GOTCHA.  DMX's gate reads "Defeat N Stage VI Digimon", and
humulos' dmx.json spells the ladder out verbatim:

    "Stage V (Perfect)"   == EN **Ultimate**
    "Stage VI (Ultimate)" == EN **Mega**      (WarGreymon, MetalGarurumon)

We counted ("Ultimate", "Mega"), folding all of Stage V in.  That swept 44% of
the enemy roster instead of 17%, silently loosening every KO6 evolution gate and
turning the "Mega-class" eggs into early-game errands (Ultimates are ordinary
random encounters in map 1 zone 1; the first random *Mega* is map 1 zone 4).

⛔ ALBUM COUNTS STAGES, NOT PETS.  album_add fires on every save, so one pet's
run to Mega records SIX species (Fresh/InTraining/Rookie/Champion/Ultimate/Mega).
Nine eggs were gated at 3/5/6/8 -- i.e. every one of them inside the player's
first ~1.5 pets.  The album axis must span GENERATIONS.
