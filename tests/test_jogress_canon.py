"""Jogress doors vs humulos canon (audit 2026-07-17, the LV-fix treatment).

Verified this audit: Omnimon (WarGreymon+MetalGarurumon), Omnimon Alter-S
(BlitzGreymon+CresGarurumon), RustTyrannomon (Machinedramon+Aegisdramon),
Examon (Slayerdramon+Breakdramon), GraceNovamon (Apollomon+Dianamon),
Mastemon (Angewomon+LadyDevimon), Boltboutamon (Piemon+Vamdemon -- wikimon
confirms, the pair looked wrong and wasn't).  FIXED: Chaosmon's BanchoLeomon
side and Rafflesimon's Lotusmon side were missing their doors (symmetric
canon); the name-intersection channel let two WarGreymons mirror-fuse
(exact doors now bind to the peer's NUM); and Jesmon GX is canon ONE-SIDED
("only Jesmon X ... can be used to evolve Gankoomon X"), which the
both-or-neither lobby could never open -- the COMPANION role fixes it.
(Alphamon Ouryuken stays out: Ouryuken isn't in the DVPet roster.)
