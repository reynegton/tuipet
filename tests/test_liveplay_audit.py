"""LIVE-PLAY AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Three QA personas played the game headlessly overnight (caretaker / chaos
/ grinder).  The chaos player's finds, all in the poisoned-save path —
a SUPPORTED path: load()'s contract is .bak -> quarantine -> "Starting
fresh", never a raise (a crash at load is a crash LOOP: the .bak holds the
same poison).

L1 (FIXED) — TWO MIGRATIONS CRASHED BEFORE ANY CHECK RAN.  The manners
heal (`float(data.get("obedience"))`) and the interrupted-wager settle
(`dna_wager_pending > 0`) both ran ahead of the wrong-type rejection list,
so a string in either field raised straight out of pet_from_save -- and
load() called it OUTSIDE its try, so the promised fallback never got the
chance.  Boot crash (app.py loads at startup).

L2 (FIXED) — THE 13-FIELD TYPE LIST MISSED ~20 FIELDS.  stage_seconds,
calories, strength, care_mistakes, gift_t, tourney_alarm, anim_ttl,
full_until, adv_progress, town_bought, daily_mood ... a save poisoned in
any of them loaded "fine" and crashed on the first tick or first render --
exactly the failure the list's own comment says it exists to prevent.

THE FIX, both levels: a GENERIC type gate over fields(Pet) -- every save
value must match its dataclass default's shape, checked BEFORE the
migrations; one sweep, no list to forget (a defense is only as good as
its worst consumer).  And load() wraps pet_from_save in the belt: any
raise that slips a future gate lands in the same fallback chain.
