"""WHAT EACH ITEM MOVES — items refactor P2 (2026-07-23).

Joel: "we gotta redo them all to fit everything we got going on."

`Item.touches` is the machine-readable answer to "what does this item
actually do", read out of petcare's handlers rather than out of the
effect PROSE (which is exactly the thing that drifts -- plan §1g).

These pins are the teeth of that:

  * every touched name is a REAL Pet field (catches typos and renames),
  * no item aims at a DORMANT stat -- the strip left ~11 fields with
    zero read/write sites, and an item whose whole point is one of them
    is an item that does nothing,
  * road items stay honestly empty, since from the home bag they only
    refuse.

The DORMANT list below is the plan's live-stat ledger (§1d), measured by
counting real read/write sites outside pet.py and the persistence layer.
If a system is ever REVIVED, delete it from this list -- do not delete
the assertion.
