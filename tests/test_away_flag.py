"""The AWAY flag — set by the road, read by the body (2026-07-21).

Joel's @-line question ("shouldnt the @ say what zone the mon is in during
adventure?") uncovered a dangling wire: every consumer of pet.away existed
(the assistant's canon _isHome gate, filth, gift call, the app's death
clear) but NOTHING ever set it — the setter died with the old adventure.
Pins: the teleport toggles it both ways (canon), the status card's @ line
goes live with the zone, and the assistant truly pauses on the road.
