"""THE EFFECT PASS — items refactor P5 (2026-07-23).

Three rulings land here:

  R3  "make them symmetric" -> BOTH cures are free care-menu buttons.
      The Bandage left the shelf; ailments cost TIME, not bits.
  R4  the Textbook goes back to canon `+Obedience` (items.csv row 0) --
      the first item support the restored discipline system has had.
  R8  the mistake-eraser is KEPT, nerfed to one-at-a-time, and rehoused
      on its own item.

R8 is the one worth explaining.  Care mistakes are a DEATH clock, not an
evolution gate: 20 kills outright, an Ultimate/Mega dies at 5 once two
game-days into the stage, and the hazard ladder runs 100x steeper from 5
to 20.  The counter resets on every evolution -- but 241 of 417 Megas
have no outgoing evolution at all, so for those it never resets again and
the eraser is the only way back from a death sentence.

The item was FOUND, not invented: foods.csv row 18 (Miracle Drink) is the
only consumable in either sheet carrying `Mistake = -1`.
