"""Anim/fx timing audit (2026-07): the beat tables vs SpriteAnim's frame
scripts.  The visual-fidelity arc (v0.2.118-122) verified the SHAPES by
rasterized comparison; this audit re-verified the NUMBERS.

Verified: the foundational tick mapping (_interval = targetFPS/10 = 0.1s
at 60fps -- one tuipet 10Hz tick IS one DVPet interval, exactly), the eat
script beat-for-beat (descent 0/2/4/6, open/bite alternation at
pow(10..34, mod) with the eat/eat/lastBite cues, the heavy-species 18->26
skip), the evolve strobe alternation (lightsOff/evol at +5/+10/+12/+14/
+19..., the covered swap), the hatch script (rock 4..15, cracks 16/19,
sound at t0.6), and mood_pose as the documented condensation of
checkMoodFrame.

Fixed (canon divergences):
 * The GERIATRIC SHUFFLE was missing: stepFrame walks an old pet on
   spriteNum+9 -- the aged idle toggles the dejected/collapse frames.
 * The eat grimace (+9 bite) fires on an OVEREATING stomach too, not
   only disliked food (canon: hunger >= overeatLimit at anim time)."""
