"""THE BODY TELLS — poopdance + yawn.

⚠ E4 AUDIT 2026-07-23, and the finding is about this file's first draft.
These two fx have been firing since **v0.2.337** from app.py's own idle
roll — gated on POOPDANCE_AT of the bowel gauge and on
`pet.near_bedtime()`, a helper whose docstring literally says it is
"the yawning special idle's eligibility".  v0.5.211 "restored" them a
SECOND time, through a `_special_idle` branch and an `idle_fx` mailbox,
because the survey grepped for a literal `start_fx("name")` and the
real call site passes a VARIABLE (`random.choice(specials)`) — the same
class of miss that hid the `losing` fx earlier the same day.

The duplicate was removed.  These pins now guard the ORIGINAL path, so
nobody (me) re-adds a second one.
