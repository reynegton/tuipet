"""THE ATTRIBUTE CHIPS — items refactor P6 (2026-07-23).

Joel: "do p6".

P6 was "R5 additions, if any" from the dark-sprite pool (87 packaged DVPet
rips that nothing could reach).  The bar I held them to is the one that
worked for the Miracle Drink: an addition must be CANON DATA landing on a
LIVE stat -- never an invented effect, never a revived system.

Of the 86 candidates, 70 have some live-looking leg, but almost all were
ruled out for a stated reason (see the board).  What survived is the
attribute chips, because Va/D/Vi is the biggest live lever in the game
with nothing buyable behind it: hundreds of evolution rows gate on it,
battle power reads it, and the only ways to move it were +1 per battle
win and the inheritance-only Digimemory.

Deliberately NOT added, and each pin below records why, so a later pass
doesn't quietly undo the reasoning.
