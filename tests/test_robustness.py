"""Edge-case robustness (Workstream B).

A fuzz of ~30 edge inputs found the game degrades gracefully everywhere a user can
reach: a brand-new empty account, 0-bit purchases, dead-pet actions, corrupt /
partial / unknown-num saves, offline extremes, out-of-range egg indices. (The lone
crash, Pet.from_num on a nonexistent num, is an internal fail-loud on a data-
integrity error, not user-reachable — left as-is.) These tests pin the graceful
paths so a refactor can't turn them back into crashes.
