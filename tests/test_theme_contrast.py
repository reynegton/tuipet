"""Theme legibility RATCHET (theme-variant audit 2026-07-22).

tools/theme_sheet.py renders every panel under every theme and scores
each style span's WCAG contrast; this pins the palette itself so an
edit can't quietly ship grey-on-grey.  The audit's finds, fixed here:
grey's coin gold read 1.48:1 on the light box and gameboy's coin olive
1.97:1 on the pea LCD.  (The audit also flagged the terminal-cyan key
letters as palette roulette -- but cyan keys are PINNED design from the
shell-revert ruling (test_theme), so they stand until a named order.)

Thresholds are the shipped floor, not aspiration: text pairs >= 3.0:1,
status tints >= 2.0:1 (the quiet default's DIM is quiet BY DESIGN --
grey mid sits at 2.36 and stays).  Silhouette inks are exempt: they
draw over scene art and are meant to hug it."""
