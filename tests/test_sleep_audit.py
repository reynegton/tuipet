"""THE SLEEP AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Joel: "lets do a full blown sleep audit next."

S1 (FIXED) — THE RAID BOARD FOUGHT A SLEEPING PET.  The raid gate landed
in the battle audit (2026-07-25) copying the BODY half of the house rule
— "a volley is a fight you CHOOSE, so the body answers first" — and left
the SLEEP half behind.  Measured on the real panel: a sleeping pet threw
a full volley with `asleep=True, disturb=0`, the bout launched, and the
pet slept through its own raid.  It was the ONLY fight door in the game
that neither woke the sleeper nor refused: the home key (`can_battle`),
both cups (`can_enter`), training, adventure, jogress and every care key
wake it and bill the disturb; the lobby is the deliberate opposite and
refuses without touching the pet, because a stranger's invite is not the
player's finger.  Fixed in raidscreen.key(): the sleeper answers first.

S2 (DOC, not behaviour) — LINES_SPEC §5 said a lit sleeper logs "the
once-per-night lights mistake".  The shipped device books one every 120
lit minutes (measured: 1.5/3.5/5.5/7.5/9.5h into a lit 10-hour night, so
~5 a night), which is canon-derived and deliberate — `_tick_asleep` says
so in a dated comment.  The CONTRACT was the wrong half; §5 now matches
the device.  The behaviour is pinned here so the next reader of that
paragraph doesn't "fix" the code to it.

CLEARED, not defects (each was measured before it was believed):
  * Waking a sleeper costs a DISTURB, never a care mistake — and the
    disturb is real currency: 208 corpus forms gate on it and a single
    one flips `select()`.  An earlier reading of "mistakes 0->1" on a fed
    sleeper was an OVERFEED slip on a full pet, which never woke at all.
  * Per-form bedtimes (20:00 / 21:00 / 22:00 / 23:00 / midnight) with a
    7:00-sharp wake for every one — LINES_SPEC §5 exactly.
  * `battle_condition()` returning None on a sleeper is BY DESIGN: it is
    documented as the pure condition half, and its callers own the sleep
    clause.  After S1 they all do.
