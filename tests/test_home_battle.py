"""The home BATTLE action (Joel 2026-07-23: "should we add battles
action into the system? like dm20 does it?" -> "yeah lets do it").

A first-class action-bar bout: tier-matched rival (battle.pick_enemy,
same stage bracket -- no punching down for free egg-gate wins), a REAL
record (wins/exp/KO6/log/+2 trainings, exactly like a road wild), and
NO purse -- adventure stays the earning game.  Energy is the pacer:
can_battle's >= 10 entry gate, -5 per bout, ~3 per full tank.
