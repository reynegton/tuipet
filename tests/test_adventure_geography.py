"""Adventure rebuild — the real 26-ZONE GEOGRAPHY (phase 4, 2026-07-20).

Pins the wiring of data/zones.csv + enemies.csv into 26 run-zones: one biome per
run (the gate boss's terrain, no mid-zone span-hopping), each with its OWN wild
enemy table.  Joel's order: "wire the real 26 zones after encounters."
