"""THE BATTLE AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Joel: "we gotta do a full blown battle audit. we did a bunch of changes
recently and we gotta make sure its hooked up correctly."

The recent run — the home battle key (v0.5.198), the Pen20 lock rework
(199-204), injury (205), the rolling win gate (212), the one-card rule
(179), death-is-final (180), the cup's single entrance (240) — landed
across five different doors into one engine.  These pins hold the seams:

  * THE HURRY KEY MAY ONLY HURRY.  A mashed SPACE snapped the playhead
    back to the start of the closing impact run, every press, so the
    round replayed forever and the fight sat frozen (4000 frames of
    pressing every frame never left round 1; sparse presses finish in
    ~80).  Joel plays on a phone — tap-tap-tap is the normal input.
  * ONE ENGINE, FIVE DOORS: what each source bills and feeds.
  * THE CONDITION GATE holds on every CHOSEN fight.
  * THE LOCK is pure upside and reaches the fight it was locked for.
