"""Energy-system canon audit pins (2026-07-06) vs DVPet PhysicalState.

setEnergy itself was rebuilt in the mood arc; this audit covered the rest.
Sleep/nap regeneration and the perfect-conditions bounce verified verbatim
(NapEnergyGain is 1 for ALL 1574 species -- the flat +1 was already right).
Found: the item loader int()'d FRACTIONAL energies to zero (canon applyItem
treats a sub-1 value as a share of maxEnergy -- the X-Program's -0.8, the
Digimentals' -0.66), the X-Program/ItemEvol branches skipped the applyItem
stat core entirely, and can_battle/can_train carried invented hard gates
(MinEnergyForActivity is -127 on the classic column; the refusal roll is
canon's only gate)."""
