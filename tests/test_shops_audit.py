"""THE SHOPS AUDIT — the pins (2026-07-25).

Joel: "lets do a full blown shops audit next."

S1 (FIXED) — THE WAVE TEASE CHANGED BETWEEN LAUNCHES.  `wave_status`
picked the closest sealed Digimental wave with `max(set(sealed), ...)`.
That walks a SET, so when two waves tied on ratio the winner fell out of
string-hash iteration order — which Python randomises PER PROCESS.
Measured across seven `PYTHONHASHSEED` values, one identical save printed
either "wins 0/25 wake Light & Kindness" or "generation 0/5 wakes
Destiny"; 7% of sampled progress states sit on such a tie (any player at
gen 5+ with no armor evo and no wins).  A shop's character is supposed to
be STABLE — the same law that keeps a town's guest good crc32-ordered and
its daily deal fixed for the day.  Ties now break toward the NEAREST goal
(smallest `need`), which is also the more useful tease.

EVERYTHING ELSE MEASURED CLEAN, and the measurement ships as pins — the
same call as the evolution audit.  The most valuable of them is the
ANTI-PRINTER law, because that is the one an economy dies of:

  * The trade game IS profitable by design ("buy a family's exclusive ON
    DEAL, carry it to the OTHER family's towns"), and the F5 ruling
    (item sweep 2026-07-24) is what keeps it honest: a profitable flip
    must be RATIONED.  Every one of them is — pinned below.
  * I nearly "fixed" a system that was already ruled on.  All 8 chips sit
    at exactly the home flip (50% of catalog) while town DEMAND pays 70%,
    which reads like a standing money loop — until you measure the
    ration: 1-2 units per town per day, which is precisely what F5 turned
    the home deal into.  Bounded is the whole law.
  * The reachable ceiling is one town per adventure run (26 zones, one
    town each), so the "+68,170b/day perfect trader" a 26-town sweep
    suggests is not a thing a player can do.  Per visit it is +1,300 to
    +5,400b against a boss bounty of 100-3,000b — a side channel, not a
    replacement.
