"""DSprite mortality (Joel 2026-07-22: "we gotta do it how dsprite does.
life bar must be a dvpet fkrgetten relic") -- the lifespan clock and its
whole LifeDec burn economy LEFT the game; death is the clone's per-minute
hazard roll again (v0.4.12 L440-454, tables verbatim):

    d = first matching DEATH_MISTAKES bracket
      + DEATH_SICK_P while sick
      + first matching DEATH_AGE bracket
    one roll per tick: random() < d * dt -> dead

Beneath the roll the discrete nets stand as before (NOT clock machinery):
the 20-mistake cap, Pen20 elder frailty (LINES_SPEC §5 contract) and the
12h starvation clock.  These pins hold the roll's shape, the immunity
window, and that NOTHING in the codebase burns or reads a lifespan."""
