"""careBonusOnReset — the whole-life report card (care-bonus audit 2026-07-05).

Canon grades the DEPARTED at the next generation's start and the result seeds
the new egg's evol_bonus.  Order matters: the Digimemory etch runs first and
SPENDS the bonus, so an etched life grades from zero + the card.  Legs (config
col 0): clean-final-stage +1 / else -mistakes; final mood Happy +1, non-Neutral
-1 (the DERIVED word since the meter left); lifetime win rate >=90 +1; whole
days past the growth curve (negative when short-lived); stage extras Champion
+1-not-Failed +1@attr175 +1@battles>30, Ultimate +2/225/50, Mega +3/300/75;
clamp >= 0.  (The obedience legs left with the discipline system -- the
pinned-0 meter docked EVERY life -1; MED audit 2026-07-19.)"""
