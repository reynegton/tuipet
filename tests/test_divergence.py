"""DNA divergence — the wild road ("ultimate v-pet" arc 2026-07-07).

The lines are the raising spine; the corpus graph reaches ~1,454 forms.
Divergence is the door: a strict-max charged Field at/over the stage
threshold steers evolution onto the graph's next-stage edge in that Field.
Unarmed pets must be bit-identical to before (the goldens enforce the rest).
