"""Adventure polish — HAZARD DODGES (arcade arc, 2026-07-21).

Pins the ambush: a marched step may spring one of the zone's own wilds
(town ground is safe), the "!" telegraphs, SPACE inside the window ducks it
clean, eating it costs the small engine-applied energy toll — and the march
resumes either way (the beat never hangs).
