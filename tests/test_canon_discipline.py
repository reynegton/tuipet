"""CANON RESTORATION B — DISCIPLINE (2026-07-23, Joel: "it was
wrongfully stripped ... whatever is canon bring back").

The device pair restored on today's tree: the obedience gauge (0..100)
is live again, the tantrum call fires and costs when ignored, SCOLD
answers it (+25), PRAISE answers a proud moment (+10, windows opened by
battle wins and mega drills, never farmable).  Refusals stay SOFT (the
standing recalibration) — discipline is the tantrum economy.
