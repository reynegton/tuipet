"""KO6 reachability under the 0.5 HP race (rewritten 2026-07-17; the old
harness drove the classic engine's trained-HP axis, which left with it).

The gate's new axes are the race's own: the trained FORM (mega doubles 90%
of blasts), the win-rate term, training experience and full care gauges.
An underdog Ultimate fells a Mega roughly 1 bout in 3 at its best -- a
grind-gate, not a wall -- while a Mega meets a Mega evenly, and raids pay
KO6 at claim besides.  Pin the GRADIENT and the floor, not old numbers."""
