"""The bar-lock reflex honesty rework (Joel 2026-07-23: "i hit the
center every time, what are you talking about").

The marker steps every 100ms and a seen-centered press lands ~200-300ms
later (human reaction + terminal latency).  The old lock graded the
single live position, so a small window silently failed presses the
player SAW land -- the same class as the hazard dodge's rework.  Now:
ONE grading source (strikefx.grade_lock) for the drill and the bout,
a LOCK_GRACE of trailing steps, the 2px marker counting both its
pixels, and the window floored at 3px (a 1px window was a 100ms
target -- physically impossible in a terminal).
