"""Lobby chat polish (2026-07-14) — cell-width safety, the 📢 line, and mute.

⛔ THE CELL-WIDTH LAW.  The lobby is the ONE screen where a player types
arbitrary text, and an emoji or CJK glyph is TWO terminal cells wide while
counting as ONE character.  `s[:w].ljust(w)` and `len(s)` measure CHARACTERS, so
"🔥🔥 emoji 日本語" overflowed its 25-column budget and shoved the roster divider
`│` right off its column — the layout visibly tore.  Every width decision in
lobbyscreen now goes through cell_len / set_cell_size / chop_cells.
