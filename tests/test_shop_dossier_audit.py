"""Shop-dossier truth audit (2026-07-22, the help-audit method): every
catalog blurb exercised against its handler.  Verdict: the shelf tells
the truth -- every dial, timer and refusal matches its words.  The one
lie found was a COMMENT, not a blurb: the X-Antibody chip claimed the
unmarked-pet death roulette ran "below" -- that roulette belonged to the
removed X-PROGRAM item (strict-DSprite shelf cut 2026-07-17) and its
orphan constants are retired with it.  The chip is, and always was, the
safe path."""
