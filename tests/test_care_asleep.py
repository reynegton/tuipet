"""Care actions on a SLEEPING pet: the first press is a disturbance, never the
action (PhysicalState.disturb()).  Canon disturb semantics: the pet WAKES
grumpy -- fully if it's nearly rested (or its energy bar is full), otherwise
its sleep is postponed and it drops back off shortly.  Either way the pressed
action does NOT apply on that press.

A disturb carries its OWN canon side effects (the worse-sick roll and the
wake roll -- pinned in test_mood_system); these tests pin the rolls to their
no-op tails so only the pressed action's effect is measured."""
