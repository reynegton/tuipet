"""CATEGORIES — items refactor P3 + P4 (2026-07-23).

Joel: "r1 b, r2 yes rename them".

P3 re-cut the category set so each name maps to a LIVE system instead of
to vibes.  The two that LIED are gone: "Medical" held death and
inheritance (never a med), and "Evolution" held the dumbbell.

P4 makes the set visible the way R1=b asked -- as dim sub-headers INSIDE
the Items tab, not as more tabs.  The tab bar is 38 cells and silently
truncates (plan audit A2), so eight tabs would simply vanish; sub-headers
scroll with the list and are not capped at all.

The pins below guard the thing the plan called goal 1: ONE grouping, not
three.  Before this arc the catalog said six categories, use_item's
comments said five, and the tab bar said four.
