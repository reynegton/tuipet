"""THE CATALOG RECORD — items refactor P1 (2026-07-23).

Joel: "take all items, make sure theyre in catagories, and we gotta redo
them all to fit everything we got going on."  P1 is the mechanical half:
the authored 6-tuple becomes a NAMED record so consumers stop saying
`v[3]` and start saying `.category`.

These pins guard the two things P1 promises -- that the rename is
BEHAVIOUR-FREE, and that the field order is the authored order (P2 widens
this record, and a silent field reshuffle would corrupt every read).
