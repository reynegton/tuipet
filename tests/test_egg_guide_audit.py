"""Egg-guide truth audit (2026-07-22, the help-audit method): every
LockedDescription is the guide's ONLY story for its gate -- tourney gates
don't even have a live counter branch -- so each desc must tell the gate
it fronts.  Found and fixed: Dokimon claimed "a Mega tournament in
Summer" for plain Summer Open #147, Hack Egg a "Fall Champion Cup" that
does not exist (Fall Open #188).  Verified true in the same pass: the
raid family's strict-greater map comparator (map:0 = 1 boss -- no
off-by-one), the live "clear adventure map N" alternative (adventure
zone conquest still writes the maps channel), and every counter desc
carrying its real number."""
