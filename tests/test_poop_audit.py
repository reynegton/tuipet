"""Poop/filth audit vs the decompile (2026-07-15) — VERDICT: MATCHES.

The sweep found no mechanical divergence: poop() (relief mood, the
floor(baseWeight x 0.1) weight shed capped at 4, sizes 3/1/2 by base weight,
the backlog upgrade + extra shed + gauge zero, the carried remainder),
addFilth's full-room upgrade, startPoop's asleep 2x desperate hold, the
toilet-training arc (1 InTraining use, obedience >= 50, Rookie+ auto,
Toilet-before-Potty), checkFilthSick's species-scaled bound, the species
filth mood, obedienceLapse billing the mess, poopWaitMoodCheck, sickPenalty's
racing bowels, and the bad-med/bad-vitamin lurches all match canon (or its
documented tuipet adaptations: the 4-pile cap, the retired poopCall mistake
-- data-dead in canon anyway at limit 7 vs array 6 -- and the acting-up
scold in its place).  These pins lock the audited invariants that had none.

The one live canon constant with no tuipet counterpart is
PostponePoopMoodChange (-1): canon's anim-state machine can BLOCK a poop and
charge mood per blocked minute; tuipet has no blocking state (the pile drops
the tick the gauge crosses), so the postpone path cannot exist.
